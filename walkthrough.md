# 1. Project Overview - Game Guesser
This Java project generates 7 random games, alongside their genre, type, engine, company, platform, name, and summary, from the [IDGB API](https://www.igdb.com/api). The game allows the user to choose either completely random games or specified genres. It then chooses a correct game from that list and prompts the user to guess for it using hints that the game outputs.
